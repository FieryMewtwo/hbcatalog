title: Homebrew Catalog Frontend

---
A simple yet expansive catalog of Nintendo homebrew, CFW, and payloads. This is not a guide to hacking your device, see Plialect's Guide at hacks.guide or the SDSetup Team's homebrew guide at homebrew.guide for this.

A word of warning: Do NOT follow a hacking guide you find on YouTube or another video-sharing platform. They put you and your device in unnecessary danger. Use the guides listed above instead
